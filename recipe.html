        Grill the Chicken:
    </h3>
    Season chicken on all sides with salt in a medium bowl. Add vinegar and garlic and toss to coat. Let sit 15 minutes.

            Lightly brush grill grate with vegetable oil. Grill peppers over high heat, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and blistered all over, 15–20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit until cool enough to handle.
            Remove skins and seeds from peppers; discard. Purée peppers, garlic, vinegar, almond butter, olive oil, salt, and cayenne in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl .
        </li>
